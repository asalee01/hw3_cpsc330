    "Typically, data isn't readily formatted for direct input into machine learning models. It's crucial for a machine learning practitioner to examine each column and determine an effective method for encoding its information. Let's determine the types of features we have and come up with suitable encoding strategies for them. "

    "| age | scaling with `StandardScaler` |  A numeric feature with no missing values, ranging from 17 to 90. Scaling is recommended due to its distinct range compared to other numeric features. While MinMaxScaler might be more suitable, using StandardScaler should be fine too.|\n",
    "| workclass | imputation, one-hot encoding | |\n",
    "| fnlwgt | drop | As this feature has no description and the histograms for both income classes are very similar, it is best to omit it to reduce training complexity. |\n",
    "| education | ordinal encoding | |\n",
    "| education.num | drop | I disagree to drop the educatio.num column as it has significant difference between classes and it stresses the fact that more educated people are more inclined to make more than 50k, removing this would rid the model of a significant feature to learn from. |\n",
    "| marital.status | one-hot encoding  | A categorical feature that is useful for the model to learn from so using one-hot encoding allows the model to utlize the categorical input as numeric. |\n",
    "| occupation | imputation, one-hot encoding  | A categorical feature that is useful for the model to learn from so using one-hot encoding allows the model to utlize the categorical input as numeric. |\n",
    "| relationship | one-hot encoding  | A categorical feature that is useful for the model to learn from so using one-hot encoding allows the model to utlize the categorical input as numeric. |\n",
    "| race | drop  |  |\n",
    "| sex | one-hot encoding with \"binary=True\" | It is used to separate each sex to a separate column with the sex name, in this dataset there are only 2 sexes so using binary = True, will allow for the values to be either 0 or 1 only. Additionally, only encoding is needed as there is no missing values. |\n",
    "| capital.gain | scaling with `StandardScaler` | It is another numeric feature with no missing values, with range from 0 to 99999, so it has a very large range than affect other features. Scaling with standard scaler ensures the mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1, so it has no additional bias.  | \n",

Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.) Is it different than the default value for the hyperparameter used by `scikit-learn`? \n",
